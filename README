I created unit tests in ShopServiceTest, they cover most of the logic.

Improvements:
* Swagger for the Rest endpoints, i didn't prioritize this
* documented endpoints, would be easier with swagger, but not prioritized
* running the tests with autowired service
* more proper logging of events

* for bigger projects grouping the objects in DTOs (Cost) and internal objects (Watch)
* not really made for communicating with database so that would require som refactoring
